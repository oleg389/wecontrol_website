                            In 2015, the Ukrainian market was represented only by internet banking and mobile
                            applications from
                            the largest banks. The National Bank of Ukraine had just begun to implement legislation
                            regulating
                            e-wallets. The FinTech project Simple was launched in the USA, and Rocketbank and TCS in
                            Russia. These
                            were the first mobile only banks, which had no analogues in Ukraine due to imperfect
                            legislation. The
                            lack of products for conveniently making online payments and managing personal finances was
                            a problem
                            that needed to be solved.
